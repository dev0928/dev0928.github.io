## What are low-code platforms?

Low-code is a software development approach where application developers use drag-and-drop easy-to-use interfaces to develop applications. These platforms come with an IDE containing code validation. This enables **citizen developers** (developers without any programming background) to create custom business applications to suit their needs.

## Why use low-code platforms?

Here are some of the benefits of low-code platforms:

- Low-code platforms enable rapid application development with a web-based visual interface. There is no need to set up special development environments to work with most low-code platforms. 
- They provide ready-to-use web-based deployment environments by eliminating the need for a deployment infrastructure setup. 
- It is easier to develop equivalent mobile-friendly versions of web-based solutions with low-code platforms.
- A study conducted by IDC [IDC](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US48223621 "IDC Study") suggests that there is going to be a shortage of 4M full-time developers by 2025. But with low-code platforms, business teams do not have to fully rely on IT teams for custom business application development.

## Examples of low-code platforms

There are over **200** low-code/no-code providers in the market today. These providers specialize in various application types. Some of the leading low-code providers that specialize in the enterprise application space are [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/, "Microsoft Power Platform"), [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com/ "Mendix"), and [OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/ "Out Systems"). There are several cloud providers that provide low-code solutions in the ML/Analytics space as well - [Google AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl/ "Google Auto ML"), [Azure ML Studio](https://ml.azure.com/ "Azure ML Studio"), [Amazon SageMaker Canvas](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/canvas/ "Amazon Sage Maker")

## Conclusion

While starting a new build project, it will be beneficial to evaluate the available options before deciding to build the solution using the traditional approach. This may result in a reduced total cost of ownership and faster time to market which is the ultimate goal of any business.
