My name is Saku Ramamoorthy. I am a tech lead with a breadth of experience in a wide range of back-end and cloud technologies. I am passionate about learning and gaining new skills. I enjoy applying new technologies to develop robust and maintainable systems.  

I am planning to share my notes through this blog. I also blog at [dev.to](https://dev.to/dev0928/ "dev0928").
